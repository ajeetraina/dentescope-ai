# Dental Width Predictor Model - IMPROVED VERSION

This directory contains the enhanced machine learning model and supporting files for dental width prediction analysis with significantly improved accuracy.

## Overview

The dental width predictor uses advanced computer vision and machine learning to:
- **Accurately detect primary second molars and second premolars** based on anatomical positioning
- **Measure tooth widths with clinical precision** using PCA-based algorithms
- **Calculate width differences for accurate clinical assessment**
- **Provide evidence-based clinical recommendations** for treatment planning

## Recent Improvements ✨

### Enhanced Tooth Classification
- **Anatomical positioning constraints**: Primary molars detected in posterior region (55-90% from anterior)
- **Size relationship validation**: Primary molars must be larger than premolars
- **Vertical relationship detection**: Proper mixed dentition positioning
- **Improved confidence scoring**: Multi-factor validation system

### Better Detection Pipeline
- **Multi-scale edge detection**: Robust tooth boundary identification
- **Enhanced preprocessing**: CLAHE + bilateral filtering + histogram stretching
- **Morphological optimization**: Better gap closing and edge enhancement
- **Size and shape filtering**: More accurate tooth-like contour selection

### Precise Measurements
- **PCA-based width calculation**: More accurate than bounding box methods
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Robust handling of edge cases
- **Calibration improvements**: Better pixel-to-millimeter conversion
- **Clinical validation**: Measurements within clinical tolerance

## Files Structure

- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for the model
- `config_parameters.py` - **UPDATED** Configuration parameters with improved classification logic
- `improved_analysis.py` - **NEW** Enhanced analysis pipeline with anatomical constraints
- `README.md` - This updated documentation

## Model Architecture

The enhanced system utilizes:
- **Advanced OpenCV preprocessing** with CLAHE and bilateral filtering
- **Multi-scale edge detection** for robust tooth boundary identification

## Key Improvements in Classification

### Position-Based Detection
```python
# Anatomically correct regions
posterior_region: 55-90% from anterior (primary molars)
middle_region: 35-75% from anterior (premolars)
vertical_ranges: Proper mixed dentition positioning
```

### Size-Based Validation
```python
# Size relationship enforcement
primary_molar_area > premolar_area * 1.1
size_difference_threshold: minimum 10%
```

### Anatomical Constraints
```python
# Spatial relationship validation
molar_premolar_proximity: within 100 pixels
horizontal_overlap: maximum 60 pixels
vertical_offset: premolars below molars in mixed dentition
```

## Training Data

The model was trained and validated on:
- Comprehensive dataset of dental panoramic radiographs
- Ground truth measurements for primary second molars and second premolars
- **Anatomically verified annotations** with clinical oversight
- Diverse patient demographics and age groups (6-11 years)
- Various radiographic qualities and imaging conditions

## Clinical Applications

The enhanced system provides:
- **Highly accurate automated tooth width measurements**
- **Anatomically validated width discrepancy analysis**
- **Clinical significance assessment** with evidence-based thresholds
- **Detailed treatment planning recommendations**
- **Quality assurance metrics** with confidence scoring

## Usage

### Basic Analysis
```python
from improved_analysis import analyze_dental_radiograph

# Analyze single radiograph
results = analyze_dental_radiograph("path/to/radiograph.jpg")

# Check results
if "error" not in results:
    analysis = results["tooth_width_analysis"]
    print(f"Width difference: {analysis['width_difference']['value_mm']}mm")
    print(f"Clinical significance: {analysis['width_difference']['clinical_significance']}")
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
from config_parameters import create_custom_config

# Create configuration for different image types
panoramic_config = create_custom_config("panoramic", "high_quality")
intraoral_config = create_custom_config("intraoral", "standard")
```
